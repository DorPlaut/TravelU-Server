# TravelU-Server

Welcome to TravelU-Server, the back-end server for the TravelU web-based travel application.

This project was developed using Node.js, Express, and a variety of other libraries. It is designed to be run in conjunction with the [TravelU client](https://github.com/DorPlaut/TravelU).

## Getting Started

To get started with TravelU-Server, clone this repository and install the dependencies using `npm install`. You will also need to set up a MongoDB database and obtain API keys for the various services used by the server (such as Auth0 and Google maps).

Once you have set up the necessary dependencies, you can start the server by running `npm start`.
